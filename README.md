# WIT x Airwallex Workshop — Budget Tracker

A test-driven learning project built for the Women in Tech x Airwallex workshop. You'll explore a personal finance application, write test cases to achieve high code coverage, and then hunt down bugs in intentionally broken code.

---

## What You'll Build

A **Budget Tracker** with four core modules:

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Wallet** | Manage multi-currency funds — deposit, withdraw, transfer |
| **Expense Tracker** | Record and categorize spending |
| **Budget** | Set spending limits per category and monitor status |
| **Currency Converter** | Convert amounts across 8 supported currencies |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Explore the modules interactively

```bash
python cli.py
```

This launches an interactive CLI where you can try out all four modules hands-on before writing tests.

---

## Workshop Flow

### Phase 1 — Write Tests

Your goal is to write pytest test cases for the four modules in `src/`. Tests live in the `tests/` directory. Look at `tests/test_example.py` for examples of how tests are structured.

Run your tests at any time:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Run with a coverage report to see how much of the code your tests exercise:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

Submit your score to the leaderboard:

```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```

Aim for as high a coverage percentage as possible.

### Phase 2 — Find the Bugs (Reveal)

Once the workshop facilitator activates **reveal mode**, buggy versions of the four modules become available. Run the reveal script to swap them in:

```bash
bash reveal.sh
```

Then re-run your tests against the broken code:

```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```

Your score switches from coverage % to **number of bugs caught** (out of 4). Good tests will catch bugs that manual inspection might miss.

## Module Reference

### Currency (`src/currency.py`)

Supported currencies: `AUD`, `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `JPY`, `SGD`, `CNY`, `HKD`

```python
from src.currency import convert, format_amount

convert(100, "USD", "AUD")       # float
format_amount(12.5, "USD")       # "USD 12.50"
```

### Wallet (`src/wallet.py`)

```python
from src.wallet import Wallet

wallet = Wallet()
wallet.deposit(500, "AUD")
wallet.withdraw(50, "USD")
wallet.transfer(100, "AUD", "USD")
wallet.get_balance("AUD")        # float
wallet.total_in_aud()            # float — all balances converted to AUD
```

Raises `InsufficientFundsError` on overdraft.

### Expense Tracker (`src/expense.py`)

Valid categories: `food`, `transport`, `accommodation`, `entertainment`, `shopping`, `other`

```python
from src.expense import ExpenseTracker

tracker = ExpenseTracker()
tracker.add_expense(25.0, "AUD", "food", "Lunch")
tracker.get_by_category("food")        # list of Expense objects
tracker.total_by_category("food")      # float in AUD
tracker.total_in_aud()                 # float — all expenses in AUD
```

### Budget (`src/budget.py`)

```python
from src.budget import Budget

budget = Budget(tracker)               # pass an ExpenseTracker instance
budget.set_limit("food", 200.0)        # AUD
budget.get_remaining("food")           # float
budget.get_over_budget_categories()    # list of category names
budget.get_summary()                   # dict of status per category
```

---

## Writing Tests

Follow the **Arrange → Act → Assert** pattern:

```python
from src.currency import convert

def test_usd_to_aud():
    # Arrange
    amount = 100
    # Act
    result = convert(amount, "USD", "AUD")
    # Assert
    assert result > 0

def test_invalid_currency_raises_error():
    import pytest
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        convert(100, "USD", "XYZ")
```

Tips:
- Test both the happy path and edge cases (zero amounts, invalid inputs, insufficient funds)
- Use `pytest.raises()` to assert that errors are raised when expected
- Higher coverage = more bugs caught in Phase 2

---

## Leaderboard

The leaderboard is hosted at [wit-awx-workshop.onrender.com](https://wit-awx-workshop.onrender.com) and auto-refreshes every 5 seconds.

- **Phase 1**: ranked by test coverage %
- **Phase 2**: ranked by bugs caught, then coverage %

---

## Running the Leaderboard Server (Facilitators)

### Local development

Add your admin key to a `.env` file in the project root:

```
ADMIN_KEY=your-secret-key
```

Then start the server:

```bash
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
flask --app server/main.py run --port 8080
```

> **Note:** macOS reserves port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver. Use `--port 8080` (or any other free port) to avoid the conflict.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` — the leaderboard and admin controls are on the same page.

### Production (Render)

```bash
gunicorn server.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Set `ADMIN_KEY` as an environment variable in your Render dashboard.

### Admin controls

The **Flip to Reveal** and **Reset** buttons are in the top-right corner of the leaderboard page. No key entry required — the server reads `ADMIN_KEY` from the environment and embeds it automatically.

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| Flip to Reveal | Switches to Phase 2; disables itself once active |
| Reset | Clears all scores and returns to Phase 1 (asks for confirmation) |
